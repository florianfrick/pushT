# pushT

Attempting to solve the pushT problem by finetuning a small LLM, like moondream or huggingface's smolVLMs.
This approach proved unsuccessful, as the language aspect of these vision/language/action (VLA) models is unhelpful and makes training more difficult.
Their benefit is in diverse applications of a model, where an understanding of language seems to help generalize to many tasks.
